			<p>I'm an embedded software developer who makes open source projects. I specialize in computer graphics and networks. I like having a corner on the web although I don't write much. In fact, most of what I do with this page is designing it making it work. Here, you can see me document my projects and write a bit. I do hope to be helpful or inspiring. You can reach me at vrtxrry@pm.me to say hi. I would love to hear from you.</p>
			<h2>Birb</h2>
			<p>Here's my late cockatiel friend Birb. He always sung and loved a branch of millet. He would accompany me on the computer and rest under the monitor. He was with me in a time I never wish to forget.</p>
